# Partial-Differential-Equations
Developed for Numerical Calculus by Eduardo Savian de Oliveira, Gabriel Abraham, Marcos Augusto Fehlauer Pereira, Rômulo Pedro Thomsen, Vinícius Wentz Ritzel

## Objectives

Develop a theoretical foundation and application on partial differential equations and a presentation with the following topics:

1. Definition;

2. Laplace's equation and solution techniques;

3. **Boundary Conditions and Control Volume Approach.**
